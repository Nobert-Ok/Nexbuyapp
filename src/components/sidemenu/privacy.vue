            <h2>Does Nexbuy District Share Your Personal Information?
            </h2>
            <p>Information about our customers is an important part of 
               our business, and we are not in the business of selling 
               our customers’ personal information to others. We share 
               customers’ personal information only as described below:
                Transactions involving Third Parties: We make available
                 to you services, products, applications, or skills 
                 provided by third parties for use on or through Nexbuy's 
                 services. For example, you can order products from third 
                 parties through our stores. We also offer services or 
                 sell product lines jointly with third-party businesses, 
                 such as co-branded credit cards. You can tell when a third 
                 party is involved in your transactions, and we share customers’ 
                 personal information related to those transactions with 
                 that third party. Third-Party Service Providers: We employ 
                 other companies and individuals to perform 
                functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders 
                for products or services, delivering packages, sending postal 
                mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer 
                lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing 
                search results and links (including paid listings and links), 
                processing payments, transmitting content, scoring,
                assessing and managing credit risk, and providing customer service. 
                These third-party service providers have access to personal 
                information needed to perform their functions, but may not 
                use it for other purposes. Business Transfers: As we continue 
                to develop our business, we might sell or buy other
                businesses or services. In such transactions, customer 
                information generally is one of the transferred business 
                assets but remains subject to the promises made in any 
                pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer 
                consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Nexbuy 
                District or substantially all of its assets are acquired, 
                customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
                Protection of Amazon and Others: We release account and other 
                personal information when we believe release is appropriate to 
                comply with the law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and 
                other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of 
                Nexbuy, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information 
                with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and 
                credit risk reduction. Other than as set out above, you will 
                receive notice when personal information about you
                might be shared with third parties, and you will have 
                an opportunity to choose not to share
                the information.
